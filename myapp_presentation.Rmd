## Introduction

This is an R Markdown presentation presentation of the shiny application: 
"Summarize Your Data!. In this presentation I will show you how application works and what it does.

## The Application

- Using built-in data sets from R Studio you can now see your data.

- It provides summary statistics and the header rows for the data itself.

- It includes multiple data sets and an update view button.

- This app allows you to explore data quickly and efficiently.

## Avoid this!

Instead of having to type the code below for each data set the application does it for you

```{r USArrests, echo = TRUE}
summary(USArrests)
head(USArrests,50)
```

## Thank you
